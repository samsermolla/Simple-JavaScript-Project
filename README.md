When applied to an HTML document, it is an interpreted, full-featured programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites. It was first released in 1995 to allow users to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser.

Since then, all other graphical web browsers have embraced it. Users can use JavaScript to create modern web applications that interact immediately, without having to reload the page every time. JavaScript is used on a standard website to provide many sorts of interactivity and simplicity. Companies are continuously looking for experienced JavaScript Developers who can create unique GitHub JavaScript projects.
